#Chess C-sharp

The game's interface is simple and straightforward. The console displays the current position of the pieces using standard chess alphanumeric notation, where letters represent columns and numbers represent rows. For example, "e4" represents the square in the middle of the board.

Players can interact with the game by typing in the desired moves using this same notation. For instance, to move the white pawn from "e2" to "e4", the player would input "e2e4". The program validates these moves according to the rules of chess and updates the position of the pieces as necessary.

An interesting feature of this project is its ability to display the possible moves for the selected piece. When a player chooses a piece to move, the game analyzes the current board position and highlights the squares to which that piece can move. This helps players visualize the available options and plan their next moves strategically.

Despite being a simplified implementation, the project offers an engaging chess experience in the console, where players can enjoy the game and hone their strategic skills. It serves as an excellent introduction to the world of digital chess, providing fun and challenges for players of all levels.
